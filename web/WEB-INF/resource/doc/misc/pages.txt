Pages
-----------------

This describes purpose and configuration of $project/resource/config/page.xml

The page file configures certain runtime attributes of pages.


    key

        The unique key that provides a link to the compiled page class.

    title

        The full title of the page.

    shortTitle

        An optional shortened title.  If a short title is not provided
        the title will be used instead.

    help

        Indicates if a page help link should be displayed.
        Defaults to false.

    ssl

        Indicates if the page requires ssl encryption.
        Defaults to false.

    role

        One or more roles should be specified for each page.

        Valid roles are defined in AcRole.

        If no role is specified, then the page allows all roles but
        will generate a warning when the page file is loaded.  To
        correctly indicate a page that allows all users regardless
        of role, specify a single role with a value of *.

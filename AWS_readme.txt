Deploying software to AWS

    The following scripts are used to manage the AWS environment
        [project_home]/ant/Production
        [project_home]/ant/Test
        [project_home]/ant/Development

    1.  Perform all pre-deployment steps. e.g. Tagging, updating build number
    2.  Run the makeWarUsingTemp target to create the war file in [project_home]/temp
    3.  Run the deploy target to push the war file into the AWS environment.

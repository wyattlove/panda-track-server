/**
 * Yes, this is a clumsy and inefficient implementation.
 * We should be able to generally just pass byte arrays back
 * and forth through the JDBC protocol.  However, sending
 * large blocks of random data occasionally turns up with
 * errors (the values sent to the db don't match the values
 * subsequently retrieved).  We suspect this is a problem
 * with the JDBC driver, or that there is some escape sequency
 * that we need to use.
 *
 * An example value that does not work correctly is:
 *      a{b}c"
 * The value actually stores fine but when it is read back the
 * resultSet converts the trailing quote to a tick:
 *      a{b}c'
